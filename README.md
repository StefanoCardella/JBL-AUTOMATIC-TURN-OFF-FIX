ï½žDisable JBL Speaker Automatic Turn Off Feature


Every JBL speaker features an auto power-off function when no audio is played for 10-15 minutes. When using the JBL speaker as your computer's audio output (via aux cable or Bluetooth), it can be quite bothersome to have to manually turn it back on every time you want to listen to audio or play a video.

The following script aims to address this issue.

This script generates a brief sound every 9 minutes at a frequency so low that it is nearly imperceptible to our ears, thus preventing the automatic shutdown of your speaker.

Additionally, it's possible to configure the script to run each time your computer starts up, eliminating the need for manual execution upon each boot or system restart.

For detailed instructions, please refer to the "README.txt" file.

NB: If, when you download the file, Microsoft Defender detects it as a threat, don't worry; it's simply flagging the Python script as potentially harmful.
